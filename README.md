## Project 1: Zero Defect Manufacturing At Suppliers (Smart Six Sigma): Project Overview
- Created a tool that identifies the defective products (ball bearings) in industries using convolutional neural network trained model through the camera vision instead of eye vision. 
- Train the model over 1000 product train images which is containing both defective and non defective product images in equal percentage.(50% each)
- It also prepares the data sheet about the production details and it sends the details to the manager.
- Build a client facing API using Django frame work.

## Project 2: Under Water Object Visualization And Detection Using Laser: Project Overview
- For my final year project assignment, I build an underwater object visualizing and detecting API. 
- This could be useful for find the object in under turbid and dark side of water. 
- It also useful for detecting humans who were trapped inside the water.
- created an API which is make the project easy access using Django.
- To scan the object in the under water, I used VL53LOX which is small range distance finding sensor.(long range sensors(Lidar) are available to apparate in deep water level)
- By collecting the millions of height data points, the API gives the 3 Dimentional View of under water objects.
- For detecting object type, the 3d view converted into 2D image then passing into CNN model which is already trained model over 100 scanned under water object 2D images.
